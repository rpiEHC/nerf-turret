# Nerf Turret

This project provides the code necessary to control a "nerf turret", or any
blaster connected to a continuous rotation servo.

Begin by uploading the code to the arduino device using the arduino ide and the
`nerf.ino` file.

Then run `python controller.py`, this will capture all key presses provided the
small window is active.

It is recommended that the webcam on the turret is open and displayed to the
user during usage.
